Initially, I did sorting for listEdge(), listChildren() or toString() on the String type
of vertex name or edge label name. However, this means that I will have to enforce Comparable
on the generic types of private fields in Graph, which won't make sense if we extend to
some types with no natural ordering Point. Therefore, I only do sorting such as TreeSet
on the actual implementation of Graph in MarvelPaths or in the drivers.
