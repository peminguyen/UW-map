created graph graph

added node A to graph
added node B to graph
added node C to graph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in graph
added edge 2.000 from B to C in graph
added edge 4.000 from A to C in graph

graph contains: A B C

the children of A in graph are: B(1.000) C(4.000)
the children of B in graph are: C(2.000)
the children of C in graph are:

path from A to C:
A to B with weight 1.000
B to C with weight 2.000
total cost: 3.000
